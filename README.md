# BetterBags
Better Bags is a bag plugin that requires zero configuration. Just add to your server plugins folder and have access to four different bags! I created this bags plugin mostly for personal use. However, I found that it could be super useful for many servers! This plugin is super light-weight and will need put a ton of lag on your server.

**Current Bag Type:**  
Currently there is only 4 bag types.
-   Small (18 Slots)
-   Medium (27 Slots)
-   Large (54 Slots)
-   Ender (27 Slots) 

**How To Use:**  
-   As stated before just drop in the plugins folder and you are good to go!
-   All of the bags can be placed on the ground as normal chests and then can be picked back up if a player is  **Sneaking + Right-Click.**
-   The  **Ender-Bag**  links with your ender chest and your ender chest will link with your bag. This means whatever changes in either will update in both.

**Permissions:**  
-   bags.*
-   bags.give
-   bags.small
-   bags.medium
-   bags.large
-   bags.ender

**Commands:**  
-   /bags give small - for the small bag
-   /bags give medium - for the medium bag
-   /bags give large - for the large bag
-   /bags give ender - for the ender bag.
    -   This links with players ender chest.
